# LioWebRTC Video Chat Demo

This is a simple React app created to demonstrate the possibilities of the [LioWebRTC](https://github.com/lazorfuzz/liowebrtc) library, which makes it easy to bake peer to peer communication directly into React components.

This app uses WebRTC video/audio channels to create a p2p video conferencing room right within your component. I've also thrown in a small feature that lets the user change their window color. Thanks to the real-time bidirectional nature of WebRTC data channels, everyone else in the room can observe the changes live.
